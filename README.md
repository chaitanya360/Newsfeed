# Newsfeed

### This app uses news API from <a href="https://github.com/SauravKanchan/NewsAPI">SouravKanchan/NewsAPI</a>.

#### Features
 It has 5 categories as "tech","science","general","sports" and "entertainment".<br/>
 I have used "LAZY LOADING" pattern for dynamatically rendering images only when they are visible.<br/>
 U can read full news article on source website by clicking on "Read" button.<br/>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
